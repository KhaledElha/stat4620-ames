# Part I: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Dataset Introduction

The Ames Housing dataset contains residential home sales in Ames, Iowa from 2006–2010 and includes 79 predictors describing lot characteristics, house quality, building type, square footage, basement and garage features, and neighborhood information. The response variable for modeling is SalePrice, the sale price of each home in USD.

The dataset contains a mixture of numeric, ordinal, and nominal variables. Its initial state: 

```{r}
# summary statistics
summary(ames)

# split by variable type
numeric_vars <- ames %>% select(where(is.numeric))
categorical_vars <- ames %>% select(where(~ !is.numeric(.)))

```
## Missing Data

several variables contain missing values, but many of these are structural (“feature not present”) rather than incomplete. For example, if a house has no basement, basement quality fields are NA.


```{r}
missing_summary <- ames %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "missing") %>%
  arrange(desc(missing))

missing_summary
```

Findings:

- Variables with very high missingness include PoolQC, MiscFeature, Alley, and Fence, which is expected because most homes do not have pools, miscellaneous features, alleys, and fences

- Basement and garage quality variables also include NAs for homes without basements or garages

- LotFrontage has ~18% missingness, representing true unobserved data rather than a structural “None”

```{r}
# convert known structural NAs to "None"
ames <- ames %>%
  mutate(
    Alley        = replace_na(Alley, "None"),
    Pool.QC       = replace_na(Pool.QC, "None"),
    Fence        = replace_na(Fence, "None"),
    Misc.Feature  = replace_na(Misc.Feature, "None"),
    Fireplace.Qu  = replace_na(Fireplace.Qu, "None"),
    Garage.Type   = replace_na(Garage.Type, "None"),
    Garage.Finish = replace_na(Garage.Finish, "None"),
    Garage.Qual   = replace_na(Garage.Qual, "None"),
    Garage.Cond   = replace_na(Garage.Cond, "None"),
    Bsmt.Qual     = replace_na(Bsmt.Qual, "None"),
    Bsmt.Cond     = replace_na(Bsmt.Cond, "None"),
    Bsmt.Exposure = replace_na(Bsmt.Exposure, "None"),
    BsmtFin.Type.1 = replace_na(BsmtFin.Type.1, "None"),
    BsmtFin.Type.2 = replace_na(BsmtFin.Type.2, "None")
  )
```

## Distribution of Variables 

**SalePrice**

One notable issue is that SalePrice is heavily right-skewed, which violates the normality assumption of linear regression. 

```{r}
paste("Mean = ", round(mean(ames$SalePrice), 2))
paste("Median = ", round(median(ames$SalePrice), 2))
paste("Std Dev. = ", round(sd(ames$SalePrice), 2))
```


```{r}
# histograms
ggplot(ames, aes(x = SalePrice)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "SalePrice")
```

A log-transformation produces a much more symmetric distribution:

```{r}
# log transformation to normalize
ames <- ames %>% mutate(LogSalePrice = log(SalePrice))

ggplot(ames, aes(x = LogSalePrice)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = "red") +
  labs(title = "log(SalePrice)")
```

Skewness suggests that data transformations (e.g., log) or models that don't require linearity would be best suited for this dataset. 

**Numeric Variables**

```{r}
key_numeric <- c("Gr.Liv.Area", "Total.Bsmt.SF", "Garage.Area", "Lot.Area",
                 "X1st.Flr.SF", "X2nd.Flr.SF", "Overall.Qual")

key_numeric <- intersect(key_numeric, names(ames))

for (var in key_numeric) {
  print(
    ggplot(ames, aes_string(x = var)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = "gray") +
      labs(title = paste("Distribution of", var))
  )
}
```

## Relationships with SalePrice

**Size/area variables**
```{r}
# scatterplots for numeric predictors
size_vars <- intersect(c("Gr.Liv.Area", "Total.Bsmt.SF", "Garage.Area", "X1st.Flr.SF"), names(ames))

for (var in size_vars) {
  print(
    ggplot(ames, aes_string(x = var, y = "SalePrice")) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
      labs(title = paste("SalePrice vs", var))
  )
}
```

- GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF show strong positive linear trends.

- Outliers exist for very large homes (>4000 sq ft).


**Quality**
```{r}
# overallQual boxplot
if ("Overall.Qual" %in% names(ames)) {
  ggplot(ames, aes(x = factor(Overall.Qual), y = SalePrice)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "SalePrice by OverallQual")
}
```

Higher OverallQual correlates strongly with higher prices, showing a step-like increase.


**Neighborhood**
```{r}
# neighborhood boxplot
if ("Neighborhood" %in% names(ames)) {
  ggplot(ames, aes(x = reorder(Neighborhood, SalePrice, FUN = median),
                   y = SalePrice)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(title = "SalePrice by Neighborhood")
}
```

Neighborhoods differ substantially in median home value, implying they are relatively important predictors.

## Correlation & Collinearity

```{r}
cor_matrix <- numeric_vars %>% cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# correlation with SalePrice
cor_with_price <- sort(cor_matrix[,"SalePrice"], decreasing = TRUE)
cor_with_price

# top correlated predictors
top_corr <- names(head(cor_with_price, 10))


# Visualized (minus some to make cleaner)
ames_numeric <- numeric_vars %>%
  select(where(is.numeric), -PID, -Enclosed.Porch, -MS.SubClass, -Kitchen.AbvGr, -Mo.Sold, -Order, -Yr.Sold)

ggcorr(ames_numeric)
```
Strongest correlations: 
- OverallQual (0.79)
- GrLivArea (0.71)
- GarageCars, GarageArea, TotalBsmtSF, 1stFlrSF (~0.60 - 0.64)


multicollinearity among top predictors: 
```{r}
cor_top <- numeric_vars %>%
  select(all_of(top_corr)) %>%
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# heatmap
corrplot(cor_top, method = "color", type = "upper",
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)

# pairs plot
GGally::ggpairs(ames, columns = top_corr)

```

- GarageCars and GarageArea are highly collinear

- 1stFlrSF and TotalBsmtSF are strongly correlated

- Quality ratings like OverallQual correlate with other quality-related scores

Collinearity suggests models with regularization (Ridge/LASSO) or selective variable inclusion would work best. 

## Other Problems

**Zero-inflation** 

Several variables contain mostly zeros: 

```{r}
zero_vars <- intersect(c("Pool.Area", "Misc.Val", "Screen.Porch",
                         "Enclosed.Porch", "Low.Qual.Fin.SF"), names(ames))

for (var in zero_vars) {
  zero_prop <- mean(ames[[var]] == 0)
  cat(var, "- proportion zeros:", round(zero_prop, 3), "\n")
  
  print(
    ggplot(ames, aes_string(x = var)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = "gray50") +
      labs(title = paste("Distribution of", var))
  )
}
```

**Outliers**

```{r}
if ("Gr.Liv.Area" %in% names(ames)) {
  ggplot(ames, aes(x = GrLivArea, y = SalePrice)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Outlier Check: GrLivArea vs SalePrice")

  # view suspected outliers
  ames %>% filter(Gr.Liv.Area > 4000) %>%
    select(Gr.Liv.Area, SalePrice, Overall.Qual, Neighborhood)
}
```
Houses with very large living area (>4000 sq ft) appear to be outliers and may disproportionately influence linear regression



# Part II: Model Building

## Splitting Data

75-25 split seems right but can change this
```{r}
set.seed(4620) # So we don't get different answers every time
ames_clean <- na.omit(ames)
train_idx <- sample(1:nrow(ames), 0.75 * nrow(ames_clean))
train_data <- ames_clean[train_idx, ]
test_data <- ames_clean[-train_idx, ]
```



## PLS

A PLS approach could apply well to model the sale price of a home because it can find relationships and handle multicollinearity well. It is better suited for prediction because it cares about the response variable y (SalePrice), unlike PCR. But, we do know that there are better options out there and this is just here for comparison.

Setup for PLS:
```{r}
# install.packages("pls") # Run if not already installed, otherwise leave this commented out
library(pls)

# Only numerical in PLS
train_numeric <- train_data[, sapply(train_data, is.numeric)]
test_numeric <- test_data[, sapply(test_data, is.numeric)]


if("LogSalePrice" %in% names(train_numeric)) {
  train_numeric <- train_numeric[, !names(train_numeric) %in% "LogSalePrice"]
}
```

PLS model:
```{r}
# Fit the model on training data
fit.pls <- plsr(SalePrice ~., data=train_numeric, scale=TRUE, validation = "CV")
summary(fit.pls)
validationplot(fit.pls, val.type="MSEP")
```
It looks like 5-6 PLS components are suitable for fitting the Ames dataset. The Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (sqrt(MSEP)) turns into overfitting after that and since house prices can be highly variable. 6 components is not that much and then we can explain > 87% of sale price, so we will select 6 components.

Tuning:
```{r}
# Use 6 components
fit.pls.final <- plsr(SalePrice ~., data=train_numeric, scale=TRUE, ncomp=6)

# Predict on TEST data
pls.pred <- predict(fit.pls.final, newdata=test_numeric, ncomp=6)

# Calculate test error
test_mse <- mean((as.vector(pls.pred) - test_numeric$SalePrice)^2)
test_rmse <- sqrt(test_mse)

print(paste("Test RMSE:", round(test_rmse, 2)))
print(paste("Test MSE:", round(test_mse, 2)))
print(paste("Error as %: ", round(test_rmse*100/180796.06, 2)))
```

We can see that PLS appears to have a manageable RMSE with notably fewer components, although the test MSE still seems incredibly high. The error (in regards to the mean sale price) is about 22.5%. We will probably not move on with this one, but it is good to consider.


This can easily be taken out but it is to see if the important weights align with the expected variables from correlation in the EDA stage.
```{r}
# Get loading weights
loadings <- loading.weights(fit.pls.final)

# For the first component (usually most important)
comp1_loadings <- loadings[, 1]
comp1_sorted <- sort(abs(comp1_loadings), decreasing = TRUE)
print(head(comp1_sorted, 15))

# Visualize
barplot(head(comp1_sorted, 15), las=2, 
        main="Top Variables - Component 1 Loading Weights",
        cex.names=0.7, col="darkgreen")
```
